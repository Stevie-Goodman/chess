# Contribution Guidelines
In order to ensure that consistency is maintained across commits and pull requests, this document details how to contribute to the repository.

## Coding Conventions
 * Code should be written to be compliant with Microsoft's [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) document.
 * Whilst it may be tempting to write concise and elegant code, please keep code simple and legible. This makes code easier to interpret for team members with less experience.

## Issues
 * Issues should be appropriately tagged, titled and given a comprehensive description. There are issue templates for you to employ.
 * If you find a bug that cannot be immediately fixed, create an issue using the bug template. Stevie will then assign the issue to an appropriate team member.

## Commits
 * At the beginning of each day, don't forget to pull from GitHub to make sure you're using the most up-to-date code.
 * Commits should be appropriately titled. Where necessary, a comprehensive description may be used.
 * Each commit should include only the relevant code.
 * Commits should be performed locally once a component of a feature issue has been completed and been tested for any bugs.
 * At the end of the day, commits should be pushed to the GitHub.

## Pull Requests
 * When a feature issue has been resolved (i.e. completed), you should create a pull request from the relevant feature branch into the `production` branch.
